# ENEE408a_Web_LED
Repository of MicroPython and C programs used in Web-LED project

This repository contains the main code that was used in the creation of the ENEE408a WebLED microprocessors capstone design project at the University of Maryland. The C files are compiled and run on an STM32F446RE Nucleo board, and the MicroPython code is compiled and run on an ESP32 board. 

Note: If trying to use this code, pins may need to be changed to get it to work with your specific board(s).
